<!-- Introduction -->
## Introduction

This projected started in the beggining of my university and I setup myself to build an autonumous car that could drive alone, not using images to recognize the road but instead to use GPS coordinates that would be previousy setup and then run that path.
In the beggining the main objective was to make a car that could drive around with no problems. It started to use bluetooth to communicate but soon noticed it had a lower range so in this version, the 3rd, I used the RF24 module that uses radio waves whice increases the range.
Also the first 2 versions it was rear drive while this one I tried to see how hard it was to make a 4 wheel drive with an improved suspension.
